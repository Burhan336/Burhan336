### Frontend
- **React.js**: I leverage the power of React.js to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With React, I focus on component-based architecture, state management, and reusable UI elements.

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: These are the building blocks of the web, and I'm proficient in crafting responsive layouts, styling interfaces, and adding interactivity using vanilla JavaScript.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is my preferred utility-first CSS framework. Its utility classes allow me to rapidly build custom designs while maintaining consistency and scalability across projects.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: As a backend runtime environment, Node.js allows me to build fast and scalable server-side applications. I use it along with Express.js to create RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic efficiently.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is my go-to NoSQL database solution. Its flexibility and scalability perfectly complement my development workflow, enabling me to model complex data structures and handle large volumes of data with ease.

### Mobile Development
- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile applications, I rely on React Native. With a single codebase, I can develop high-performance apps for both iOS and Android platforms, saving time and effort while ensuring a native-like experience for users.

### Deployment
- **Firebase**: I use Firebase for hosting web applications, serverless functions, and managing app data. With its real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions, Firebase provides a seamless development experience and scalable infrastructure for deploying modern applications.

- **Heroku**: For quick and hassle-free deployment of web applications, I rely on Heroku. Its simplicity and support for various tech stacks make it an ideal choice for hosting my projects.

- **Vercel**: When it comes to deploying Next.js applications, Vercel is my preferred platform. With seamless integration and automatic deployments, I can focus on building great apps without worrying about the deployment process.
